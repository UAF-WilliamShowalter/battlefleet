Monday 3/2
We went through our user stories and assigned story points for how difficult we assumed tasks to be. We also broke the user stories into a first batch of 11 necessary features and a second grouping of features to be looked at when we have most of those done. This first group acts kind of like our first “scrum” set. We did not set a prioritization within that batch of tasks yet.

Before leaving I made a repo on github and added Jacob as a contributor, then pushed a mostly-empty Xcode project with a testing target that had the catch header file in it.

Thursday 3/5
We met for a few hours in the CS lab, from about 1:45PM until about 4:30PM or so. We only addressed one story, “I want to place a ship.” We managed to work through placing a ship, and having a ship have an associated length. We practiced paired programming, and had to setup Jacob’s laptop to be able to push to github from Xcode (previously he only had used the github GUI application). We installed SSH keys, and I went through reviewing with Jacob how git repos, commits, pushing/pulling, and what not worked. A good amount of time was spent on this.

We still need to implement placing multiple ships on the same board, which will entail having it checked that ships do not overlap.
